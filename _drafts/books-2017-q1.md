**[Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805088318/)**

Mignon Fogarty, aka Grammar Girl, is best known for her educational,
award-winning podcast Grammar Girl Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing.
With over 500 episodes, spread over more than 10 years of existence, it's
one of the longest-lived and most popular active podcasts. It's a shame
I never had the time to listen to it, so I tried to partially redeem
myself by reading this book, which could be described as the collection
of the greatest hits from the podcast.

The book delivers exactly what is promised on the cover: collection of
short and useful tips that will help you improve your writing. Grammar Girl
explores various topics, including grammar, punctuation, usage and style.
This book is especially useful if you are not a native English speaker or
don't have much writing experience. Combine it with Strunk and White's The
Elements of Style and you will get tremendous results in just a few hours.

The thing I liked the most about the book is Grammar Girl's gentle approach
to teaching. She never tries to be authoritative or judgmental, unlike most
of the other academically oriented authors writing about grammar. She also
offers a lot of examples, analogies and silly memory tricks: you will
always remember the difference between i.e. and e.g. after reading
[this](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/ie-versus-eg).

Grammar Girl's book helped me a lot and I can't recommend it enough.
If you are into audiobooks, be sure to pick up the audiobook version,
because her narration is as great as the content itself.
