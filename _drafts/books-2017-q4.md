**[HBR Guide to Better Business Writing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B0YPJ0G/)**

Bryan A. Garner is a genius, and the ultimate authority
on English language grammar and usage. His book Garner's
Modern English Usage is the essential reference for any
serious writer. HBR Guide to Better Business Writing is
much smaller in scope, but its target audience is much
larger. Don't let the title fool you—this is not
a business-specific book. Not only will it help you
write better in general but also your communication
skills will improve. Here's the author's promise
to the reader:

>You'll get better at:
>- Pushing past writer’s block.
>- Motivating readers to act.
>- Organizing your ideas.
>- Expressing your main points clearly.
>- Cutting to the chase.
>- Holding readers' attention.
>- Writing concise, useful summaries.
>- Trimming the fat from your documents.
>- Striking the right tone.
>- Avoiding grammar gaffes.

I highly recommend this book to everyone—it's by far
the best book for improving your everyday writing.

**[KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NS3NBWU/)**

This book is the first comprehensive history of the Nazi
KL system, covering everything between the founding of
Dachau in 1933 and the final liberation of camps in 1945.
Early camps were only slightly worse than the ordinary
prisons; public executions didn't happen before 1938, and
even then they required the official death sentence from
the judge. Only after the war had begun situation started
to deteriorate dramatically for the prisoners. Today,
death camps are often equated with Auschwitz, but millions
of Jews were killed in the Operation Reinhard death camps
before Auschwitz became the center of the Holocaust.
If you are a casual reader, this book might be too long
and too detailed for you, but if you want to understand
the KL system as a whole, look no further.

**[Serious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption](https://www.nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)**

Jean-Philippe Aumasson’s book on modern cryptography may
be the most important book for cryptography practitioners
since Cryptography Engineering. It’s a fantastic overview
of state-of-the-art algorithms for building cryptographically
secure systems. Author's approach to teaching cryptography
is a middle ground between theory and practice—you will learn
what are the correct crypto primitives for each situation,
but not much on how to combine them into secure protocols.
A must-read for all crypto nerds.

**[Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)**

This hidden gem is the extended version of Laurens Van
Houtven’s PyCon US 2013 [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rmCGsCYJF8)
with the same name. It will teach you cryptography by
showing you how to break it; in that sense, it's very
similar to the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).
Unfortunately, it's not finished, and it will likely
never be. For example, here is the complete chapter
on elliptic curve cryptography:

>**9.4 Elliptic curve cryptography**

Crypto 101 is a great read even in its current state.
If [lvh](https://www.lvh.io/) ever completes it, it
will probably become my favorite crypto book of all times.

**[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAKSWW1/)**

In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Kotaku game journalist
Jason Schreier tells fascinating behind-the-scenes
stories of video game development. Entertainment
industry is cruel; despite what the title says,
there is nothing triumphant about making video
games. Whether you are a solo developer or just
a part of some huge studio, your life will almost
invariably consist of months and months of 100-hour
work weeks that will ultimately lead to burnout. By
focusing only on highly successful games, the book
paints a slightly distorted picture of reality, but
that's the only complaint I have about this great book.
Every person interested in video games should read it.

**[Soviet Bus Stops](http://fuel-design.com/publishing/soviet-bus-stops/)**

Although I don't know anything about architecture,
something about Soviet buildings really fascinates
me; the most beautiful book that I have in my
library is Frédéric Chaubin's
[Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3836525194/).
Soviet Bus Stops is another stunning book showing
the strange world of Soviet architecture. The title
says everything—it's a collection of wonderful
photographs of bus stops unlike any others you've
seen previously. Most of these masterpieces are
currently decaying in the middle of nowhere, which
makes them even more captivating. Beautiful, amazing
book.
