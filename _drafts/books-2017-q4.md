**[Serious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption](https://www.nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)**

Jean-Philippe Aumasson’s book on modern cryptography may
be the most important book for cryptography practitioners
since Cryptography Engineering. It’s a fantastic overview
of state-of-the-art algorithms for building cryptographically
secure systems. Author's approach to teaching cryptography
is a middle ground between theory and practice—you will learn
what are the correct crypto primitives for each situation,
but not much on how to combine them into secure protocols.
A must-read for all crypto nerds.
