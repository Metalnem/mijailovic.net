**[HBR Guide to Better Business Writing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B0YPJ0G/)**

Bryan A. Garner is a genius, and the ultimate authority
on English language grammar and usage. His book Garner's
Modern English Usage is the essential reference for any
serious writer. HBR Guide to Better Business Writing is
much smaller in scope, but its target audience is much
larger. Don't let the title fool you—this is not
a business-specific book. Not only will it help you
write better in general but also your communication
skills will improve. Here's the author's promise
to the reader:

>You'll get better at:
>- Pushing past writer’s block.
>- Motivating readers to act.
>- Organizing your ideas.
>- Expressing your main points clearly.
>- Cutting to the chase.
>- Holding readers' attention.
>- Writing concise, useful summaries.
>- Trimming the fat from your documents.
>- Striking the right tone.
>- Avoiding grammar gaffes.

I highly recommend this book to everyone—it's by far
the best book for improving your everyday writing.

**[KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NS3NBWU/)**

This book is the first comprehensive history of the Nazi
KL system, covering everything between the founding of
Dachau in 1933 and the final liberation of camps in 1945.
Early camps were only slightly worse than the ordinary
prisons; public executions didn't happen before 1938, and
even then they required the official death sentence from
the judge. Only after the war had begun situation started
to deteriorate dramatically for the prisoners. Today,
death camps are often equated with Auschwitz, but millions
of Jews were killed in the Operation Reinhard death camps
before Auschwitz became the center of the Holocaust.
If you are a casual reader, this book might be too long
and too detailed for you, but if you want to understand
the KL system as a whole, look no further.

**[Serious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption](https://www.nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)**

Jean-Philippe Aumasson’s book on modern cryptography may
be the most important book for cryptography practitioners
since Cryptography Engineering. It’s a fantastic overview
of state-of-the-art algorithms for building cryptographically
secure systems. Author's approach to teaching cryptography
is a middle ground between theory and practice—you will learn
what are the correct crypto primitives for each situation,
but not much on how to combine them into secure protocols.
A must-read for all crypto nerds.

**[Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)**

This hidden gem is the extended version of Laurens Van
Houtven’s PyCon US 2013 [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rmCGsCYJF8)
with the same name. It will teach you cryptography by
showing you how to break it; in that sense, it's very
similar to the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).
Unfortunately, it's not finished, and it will likely
never be. For example, here is the complete chapter
on elliptic curve cryptography:

>**9.4 Elliptic curve cryptography**

>TODO: This

Crypto 101 is a great read even in its current state.
If [lvh](https://www.lvh.io/) ever completes it, it
will probably become my favorite crypto book of all times.

**[Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behind How Video Games Are Made](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAKSWW1/)**

In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Kotaku game journalist
Jason Schreier tells fascinating behind-the-scenes
stories of video game development. Entertainment
industry is cruel; despite what the title says,
there is nothing triumphant about making video
games. Whether you are a solo developer or just
a part of some huge studio, your life will almost
invariably consist of months and months of 100-hour
work weeks that will ultimately lead to burnout. By
focusing only on highly successful games, the book
paints a slightly distorted picture of reality, but
that's the only complaint I have about this great book.
Every person interested in video games should read it.

**[Soviet Bus Stops](http://fuel-design.com/publishing/soviet-bus-stops/)**

Although I don't know anything about architecture,
something about Soviet buildings really fascinates
me; the most beautiful book that I have in my
library is Frédéric Chaubin's
[Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3836525194/).
Soviet Bus Stops is another stunning book showing
the strange world of Soviet architecture. The title
says everything—it's a collection of wonderful
photographs of bus stops unlike any others you've
seen previously. Most of these masterpieces are
currently decaying in the middle of nowhere, which
makes them even more captivating. Beautiful, amazing
book.

**[The Like Switch: An Ex-FBI Agent’s Guide to Influencing, Attracting, and Winning People Over](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1476754489/)**

Every now and then I read some book about the psychology
of influence. My personal favorite in the field is Dale
Carnegie's classic How to How to Win Friends & Influence
People. The Like Switch is somewhat similar to it, but
with same important differences. While Carnegie's book
tries to make you genuinely care more about other people,
The Like Switch is more about getting what you want from
them. The differences between the two approaches can
sometimes be very subtle, but are still noticeable
(this book is also a reminder why you should never
talk to police, despite their seemingly friendly
attitude). Nevertheless, The Like Switch is a good read,
full of interesting ideas that you can apply immediately.

**[Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009U9S6FI/)**

Viktor Frankl is a Holocaust survivor, and the founder
of [logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy),
the school of psychotherapy based on a premise that the
main motivational force behind humans is their search
for meaning. First part of this book chronicles authors's
experiences in Nazi concentration camps, while the second
part describes the logotherapy itself. What I liked about
the book is that Frankl doesn't talk about some single,
abstract meaning of life in general—he states that each
person has some specific meaning. What I didn't like is
that he offers simplistic answers to very complex problems.
While will to meaning is an interesting philosophy, I don't
think it makes a good psychotherapy. It's based on anecdotal
evidence, and in my opinion is a downright dangerous way to
treat people with depression. Anyway, this is still a good
book, albeit one that I disagree with.

**[The Campus Rape Frenzy: The Attack on Due Process at America’s Universities](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1XNTYI/)**

Rape is a serious crime, and should be treated as such.
But on today's college campuses, it's been reduced to a
meaningless word. Sexual assault is handled by a bunch of
amateurs without any real investigative power. Accusers are
automatically labeled as "victims" or "survivors", in some
cases even after their fictional stories collapsed under
scrutiny. Constitutional protections that play the critical
role in the criminal justice system, such as due process,
right to have the assistance of counsel, double jeopardy,
and cross-examination, no longer apply. Presumption of
innocence? Tough luck:

>If there are 10 people who have been accused, and under a
>reasonable likelihood standard maybe one or two did it,
>it seems better to get rid of all 10 people.
>
> — <cite>Rep. Jared Polis</cite>

Authors KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor Jr. are among the
rare voices of reason in the crazy atmosphere of rape
hysteria. They completely demolish most of the accepted
"wisdom", such as the "one in five" sex assault myth.
The book is exceptionally well researched, covering
more than four dozen cases of innocent men being
convicted by the college tribunals, showing that the
injustice is the norm, and not just a handful of
isolated cases. My favorite non-fiction book in years.

**[A Listener's Guide to Free Improvisation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/022635380X/)**

After several years of listening to free jazz, I still
can't articulate what exactly I love about it. It often
lacks some standard elements that you expect in music,
such as rhythm, harmony, or melody. That's maybe why it
sounds impenetrable to newcomers. John Corbett's book
tries to teach people how to listen to improvised music.
It's short and enjoyable read, but I'm not sure if the
complete beginners can appreciate what it has to offer.
Free improvisation is best experienced live, but unless
you live in Chicago, Berlin, or London, you are probably
out of luck. The book also offers a great selection of
albums that you could listen to if you decide to give
free improvisation a try. Recommended read for all
open-minded music lovers.
