**[Serious Cryptography: A Practical Introduction to Modern Encryption](https://www.nostarch.com/seriouscrypto)**

Jean-Philippe Aumasson’s book on modern cryptography may
be the most important book for cryptography practitioners
since Cryptography Engineering. It’s a fantastic overview
of state-of-the-art algorithms for building cryptographically
secure systems. Author's approach to teaching cryptography
is a middle ground between theory and practice—you will learn
what are the correct crypto primitives for each situation,
but not much on how to combine them into secure protocols.
A must-read for all crypto nerds.

**[Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/)**

This hidden gem is the extended version of Laurens Van
Houtven’s PyCon US 2013 [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rmCGsCYJF8)
with the same name. It will teach you cryptography by
showing you how to break it; in that sense, it's very
similar to the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).
Unfortunately, it's not finished, and it will likely
never be. For example, here is the complete chapter
on elliptic curve cryptography:

Crypto 101 is a great read even in its current state.
If lvh ever completes it, it will probably become my
favorite crypto book of all times.
