**[Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0073523402/)**

Dan Luu praised this book in his post
[Programming books you might want to consider reading](https://danluu.com/programming-books/).
I've read [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033844/)
and [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1848000693/)
previously, so I thought that I was done reading general algorithms
books, but I decided it wouldn't hurt me too much if I read this one,
too. It was a great decision, because now I have
a new favorite algorithms book.

As Dan said in his review, almost everything about this book is perfect.
Selection of topics is slightly unusual (in a very good way) for
this type of book. For example, it starts with elementary number
theory, used as a tool for describing the RSA algorithm. Divide
and conquer chapter explains Fast Fourier Transform, and it was
the best explanation of FFT I've seen so far. Every chapter starts
with some basic building blocks and finally shows how they are
used to build more complex algorithms, which I think is a great approach.

This book is maybe not great choice for a first book on algorithms, because
it usually gives only high-level descriptions, without some details
necessary for their implementation. It's also not as rigorous as Cormen,
but that's not really a bad thing.

**[The Third Reich in Power](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IPZJ60/)**

This is the second book in the Richard J. Evans' Third Reich trilogy.
It is probably the most comprehensive history of the inner workings
of Nazi Germany in the period of 1933-1939, from the Hitler's
rise to power to the invasion on Poland.

Every aspect of the German life is described with incredible amount
of details. You will learn how democracy gradually eroded before it
disappeared completely, how every organized resistance was crushed in the way,
how the persecution of the Jews evolved through time,
and how the Nazi state affected every part
of the cultural life: literature, music, architecture, cinema,
religion, etc. You will also learn a lot about German economy in
the period. Evans debunks the myth of the German economic miracle,
displays the corruption of the Nazi bureaucracy and how the leaders
systematically plundered not just the Jews, but also all German citizens.

No prior knowledge is required for reading. The trilogy is
over 2500 pages long, which is probably too much for the casual
readers, but if you have the patience and you are interested
in the period, it is absolutely worth your time.

**[Maximum Insecurity: A Doctor in the Supermax](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HGZ8II8/)**

Federal judge Richard G. Kopf recommended this book in the
[Fault Lines Summer Reading List 2016](http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/fault-lines-summer-reading-list-2016/10675).
Fault Lines was the place with the best legal writing on the
internet and I completely trusted the authors with the book
recommendations. First book that I read from this list was
[Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption](https://www.amazon.com/dp/081298496X/),
(you should read it immediately if you care at all about
the justice). Maximum Insecurity was the second.

It is a story of a burned-out physician who decided to try
something new in his life and became a doctor in the Colorado
State Penitentiary supermax prison, which is a part of the
large prison complex that includes infamous
[ADX Florence](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/inside-americas-toughest-federal-prison.html).
The book is hilarious, despite the fact that the life
in federal prison is a serious business. There were many moments when
I just couldn't stop laughing. I started writing down best prisoners' quotes,
but I soon gave up, because there were just too many of them. The book shows the human
side of prisoners, and that even the most dangerous convicts are just
people, facing all the problems ordinary people face (some of
the problems are unique to the prison life, like shoulder pain
caused by doing thousands of pushups a day). Author's devotion
to his duty was admirable and I wish more people would behave
as professionally as him in their jobs. Here is what author
himself says about that late in the book:

> The worst of us are still human. Even sociopaths cry in
the night. Murderers miss their children. Child molesters
feel fear and shame. I say this not to excuse their crimes,
but to remind myself that I'm not so far removed from
members of our race who didn't or couldn't do any better.
It's what drives me to give my best efforts to those who
others might say don't deserve it.

> They might be right. Perhaps some or maybe all of these
inmates don't deserve the consideration. But I didn't become
a doctor so I could judge my patients or decide who deserves
care. As a man I might feel differently, but the
examination room is not the place for moral judgments.
I'll leave that unenviable task to the courts and the clergy.

> I remember rising with my fellow medical graduates at the
University of Michigan, throat tight with emotion,
to recite the Hippocratic Oath. It is a pledge to
always act in the best interests of my patients.

> Those words, centuries old, might seem nothing
more than a quaint ritual to some, but like a trusted mentor
I still carry every syllable into the clinic with me.
As one of my patients remarked, "You really take this
serious, don't you, Doc." I do. Perhaps my patient doesn't
deserve the best I can offer, but for my sake I can give no less.

**[A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QH9NTSI/)**

This book was on my reading list for the last several years and I
finally found some time to read it. I had very high expectations,
but I ended up slightly disappointed.

Book starts with the description of some famous stock market
bubbles and crashes, from the tulip mania to the dot-com
bubble and financial crisis of 2007â€“2008. It goes into too many
historical details, which are really interesting, but not relevant
to potential investors today. Author spends a lot of time criticizing
both fundamental and technical analysis and showing bunch of
investing techniques that don't work. He is of course correct, but I
was more interested in reading about what actually works.

Second part of the book is about investment strategies that work, and
it is really good. It describes strategies for all types of investments:
short-term and long-term, safe and risky, etc. At the end, everything boils down
to using index funds, which didn't even exist at the time the first
edition of the book came out, and in that sense this book was
revolutionary.

At the end, I'm not sure if I can recommend this book, especially
if you don't want to get into too many details and just want
to know how to invest your money, save the money for your kids'
college or just prepare for the retirement. You will probably be better
off if you just read some of the shorter articles on the topic.
Here are some that I really like:

[If you can: How to Get Rich Slowly](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)  
[Investing For Geeks](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/investing-for-geeks)  
[How I live: Organizing my finances](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-live-organizing-my-finances-2a277b6c296c)  

**[Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373321/)**

I don't know where I first heard of this book, but I was really
excited about it. I couldn't wait for it come out of early-access
program, so I purchased it as soon as all chapters were completed.
It was one of the best technical books I have read in the last few years.

The book talks about all data-related things, but it is mostly
about distributed systems. I learned something new
in almost every chapter. Topics include data models, fundamental
data structures of the storage engine, encoding and data-interchange
formats, replication, transactions, linearizability, etc. It has one
of the best descriptions of transaction isolation levels (I wish
I had read this chapter 10 years ago). Chapter on distributed
transactions is also great, with excellent explanation
of two-phase commit protocol and linearizability.

Not just that the book itself is terrific, but it also contains
hundreds of useful references. Several times I lost hours just reading
the links at the end of each chapter. I also got interested into
distributed computing more than ever before. Go read it now.

**[The Elements of User Onboarding](https://www.useronboard.com/training/)**

After reading the popular UX
[teardown](http://www.useronboard.com/how-supermariorun-onboards-new-users/)
of Super Mario Run, I noticed on the website that the author
actually wrote a book on the topic. The best way to describe it
is this picture from the book itself:

![](user-onboarding.png)

If you ever build anything that is facing customers, this is the
book you want to read. It's very short, but it doesn't waste your
time. Almost every sentence is pure gold. The book gives advice
for every step of the onboarding process, along with real-world
examples. Every advice is immediately actionable. You might also
consider buying the complete course (if the price is too high for
you, you are probably not the right audience for it). At the end
of the book you will find a carefully selected list of resources
(I watched and enjoyed several videos from that list).
If the book sounds expensive to you, you should at least read the
teardowns on the website. After doing that, you will want to buy the book.

**[Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002I1XRZY/)**

It always bothered me when people talk about a "traditional"
marriage like some kind of natural thing that existed since the
beginning of human race. I usually read books that someone
recommended to me, but this time I made an exception and went
searching for some definitive history of marriage. This book
looked like the closest thing to what I wanted to read.

The book describes all kinds of marriages that existed throughout
human history, but only the first chapter of the book was about
the weird ones, and that was the most interesting part. It turns
out that it's hard to even define marriage. Sometimes it's defined
statistically, by measuring the most common functions it performs.
Sadly, other parts of the book were not interesting to me. The
book itself is well-written, but the marriage in the last two
millennia is just not interesting institution at all. It used
to be equivalent to today's business mergers in Roman times,
the idea of romantic love in marriage started only in 19th century,
and the "traditional" marriage, with bread-winner husband and
stay-at-home wife, appeared only in the fifties.

Again, I can't say anything bad about the book itself. It
contains a lot of information, but I guess I was not
as interested in the topic as much as I thought.

**[Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L6SLKK8/)**

The United States is home to 5% of the world's population, but if
houses 25% of its prisoners. Everybody agrees that the reform
is needed, but almost everybody has a different opinion on how
it should be done, and almost everybody is wrong. John Pfaff writes
a lot about common misconceptions, and I first became familiar with
his work through his excellent article
[The War on Drugs and Prison Growth](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/faculty_scholarship/651/).
While reading this great
[interview](http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/cross-john-pfaff-challenging-conventional-wisdom-to-end-overincarceration/13253)
with him I discovered that he is writing a book on the topic
and I immediately preordered it.

The book finally came out on February 7th. It is incredibly well
researched (almost one third of the book are footnotes), but it is also
very easy to read, unlike most other academic works. Every claim
is backed by the data, mostly from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The book is divided into two parts.
The first part, called The Standard Story, talks about the common,
wrong ways people are trying to address the prison problem. Usual
suspects are The War on Drugs, long sentences and private prisons.
None of these is the real cause of why the prison population has
skyrocketed in the last few decades.

The second part of the book
gives the Pfaff's explanation of the prison growth and the real
reforms that would help solving the mass incarceration problem.
Pfaff's theory is that the real cause of the problem is increased
prosecutorial toughness. The other part of the problem, that most
people are ignoring, is that more than half of all people in
state prisons have been convicted of a violent crime. Unfortunately,
the magic wand that would solve the prison problem does not exists.
There will no bill that legislators could sign and thus end the
mass incarceration. The author says:

>Any significant reduction in the US prison population is going
to require states and counties to rethink how they punish
people convicted of violent crimes, where "rethink" means
"think about how to punish less."

Sadly, that is not the reform people would support (read
[this](http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/what-the-polls-dont-say-about-criminal-justice-reform/16253)
to see why), so at the end the author is not overly optimistic.
If you care about the topic, I would definitely
recommend reading this book.

**[Jackass Letters: Archive Volume 1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3RLDFO/)**

This short book is a collection of Christopher Jorgensen's
hilarious correspondences with various corporations and celebrities.
The recipients of his letters are NASA, Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. All of these letters can
be found [online](http://jackassletters.com/), but I still
absolutely recommend buying the book, at least for supporting the
author. It can also be a great present! If you are
not convinced, just read the excerpt his letter to Exotic Feline
Rescue Center. If it doesn't make you smile, you don't have a soul.

>Every year around this time my thoughts turn to Christmas,
which then makes me think of Jesus, which makes me think of
Christians, which makes me think of lions, and then I smile.

**[Outrageous Tales from the Old Testament](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0861660544/)**

I'm not a fan of graphic novels. I've read The Dark Knight Returns,
Watchmen, and lot of others that I can't remember right now. They
always left me unimpressed. But this collection was short and looked
interesting, because I always like good religious satire.

It's the collection of crazy stories from the Old Testament, seen through
the eyes of Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Dave Gibbons and others.
Stories are of varying quality. Some of them are quite good,
but that's usually because the original stories from the Bible
are ridiculous to begin with (Book of Job is my favorite example).
I'm not really competent to say anything about the quality of the
drawings and visual style; you might want to read the review from someone who
actually knows something about graphic novels. Anyway, this is a
very short book and you can't go wrong with it (if you can find it).

**[The Injustice System: A Murder in Miami and a Trial Gone Wrong](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074VTHES/)**

English jurist William Blackstone famously said:

>Better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.

But does that principle actually hold in practice? What does "beyond
a reasonable doubt" phrase actually mean in practice?

Kris Maharaj was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1987
for two murders he didn't commit. Author of the book, Clive
Stafford Smith, met him seven years after the conviction and
took over his case after all previous direct appeals failed.
This book is the story of the failed fight to free Kris.

Everything that is wrong in the US criminal justice system was
present in this case: incompetent public defender, lying
prosecutor and witnesses, Brady and Miranda violations, junk
forensic science. One would think that people charged with capital
murder are entitled to best possible defense, but it's actually
completely opposite in practice, because capital defense is
extremely expensive. Justice usually depends upon enthusiastic,
overworked lawyers working for free. Factually innocent clients
are the most difficult to work with; what could they possibly
tell you about the case? They are also not willing to invest
large sums of money to pay their lawyers. Why would they do that,
how could the jury possibly say they are guilty, right?

After twenty years of legal fight, the Supreme Court of the
United States denied to hear Kris' petition. Today, Kris is still
in prison. This book is required reading if you want to better
understand how justice system works in the United States and how
it's actually designed to fail. If you are still not convinced,
read Jeff Gamso's review
[here](http://gamso-forthedefense.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-valley-of-shadow-of-death.html).

**[120 Years of Vlambeer & Friends](https://www.candb.com/en/artwork/1996/120-years-of-vlambeer-en-friends-bringing-back-arcade-games-since-1896-vlambeer.html)**

Vlambeer is an independent game studio (if you can call it that,
because it's just two guys, Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman),
best known for their video games like Ridiculous Fishing and
Nuclear Throne. Former may be my favorite iOS game, and latter
is among my favorite roguelike games of all times. When I
saw at [Kotaku](http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/01/05/vlambeers-giant-book-is-fantastic)
that there is a book about them with the big collection of
artwork, I had to buy it immediately.

It's an absolutely wonderful book. It's filled up with huge amount of
beautiful design sketches and artwork, but it also contains a relatively
short history of the studio, which I also enjoyed. It's a must buy
if you love Vlambeer (and how can anybody not love them after reading
the names of the moves in their Karate game: uppera-kuttu
and eartha-shattaru), or just indie game scene. The only downside
to buying the book is that it's a bit pricey, and the shipping costs
might exceed the price of the book (it's only available
via Cook & Becker, and they offer some weird shipping options).

**[A Box of Bunny Suicides](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452292336/)**

A Box of Bunny Suicides is a literal box containing the first two
books in bunny suicides series,
[The Books of Bunny Suicides](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452285186/) and
[Return of the Bunny Suicides](https://www.amazon.com/dp/034083403X/).
Each of them is absolutely hilarious. You will read both of them in less
than half an hour. Highly recommended.

![](bunny-suicides.jpg)

**[Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C5R7F8G/)**

Command and Control presents the history of nuclear weapons
in the United States, covering topics like the Manhattan Project,
bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, development of thermonuclear
weapons, Cuban Missile Crisis, and a large number nuclear weapon accidents.

Main topic of the book is the
[1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Damascus_Titan_missile_explosion).
Amount of details Schlosser managed to collect is
impressive. Sadly, the story was quite difficult to follow. It was
intertwined with the history of nuclear weapons, and the frequent
interruptions ruined my experience. Too many people were involved
in the incident and the story requires focus that cannot be
accomplished with this presentation style. My impression is that
the book would have been much better if it was shorter.

The book was also too subjective for my taste at some moments.
Author is great reporter, but not a historian. Overall, I can't
recommend the book, but everybody else seems to like it, so
I'm probably wrong in this case.

**[The Practice of Cloud System Administration: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services, Volume 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N7N2CRQ/)**

The Practice of Cloud System Administration (commonly referred to
as The Cloud Book) came out before the famous
[SRE Book](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html), but it never
received much attention. They partially overlap,
but if you have the time, you should probably consider reading both.

This is the book about building and running large cloud-based services.
It is aimed more towards system administrators, but it will certainly
make you a better developer, too. Every aspect of designing and
operating the service is covered here. You will learn more about
high-level principles, without hearing about concrete technologies
used to achieve them. It is really important, because large part
of software companies don't even know that best practices in
running large systems exist, let alone implement them. Every topic
in the book could be expanded into a complete book (like
[The Art of Monitoring](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GU387MS/) and
[The Art of Capacity Planning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596518579/),
which are my two next stops).

Important part of the book are real-world stories; the book
is worth its price just because of them. One of my favorite chapters
talked about the Google's Disaster Recovery Testing (DiRT), which
is an exercise done at a large scale to test all kinds of disaster
scenarios. Here is an adapted example from one
real world DiRT exercise:

>A new email appears in my inbox explaining that zombies have
invaded Georgia and are trying to eat the brains of the
datacenter technicians there. The zombies have severed
the network connections to the datacenter.

If you are interested in best practices running large
cloud-based systems, or really any kind of internet-based
service, this book has my seal of approval.
