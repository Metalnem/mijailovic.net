**[Grammar Girl's Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805088318/)**

Mignon Fogarty, aka Grammar Girl, is best known for her educational,
award-winning podcast Grammar Girl Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing.
With over 500 episodes, spread over more than 10 years of existence, it's
one of the longest-lived and most popular active podcasts. It's a shame
I never had the time to listen to it, so I tried to partially redeem
myself by reading this book, which could be described as the collection
of the greatest hits from the podcast.

The book delivers exactly what is promised on the cover: collection of
short and useful tips that will help you improve your writing. Grammar Girl
explores various topics, including grammar, punctuation, usage and style.
This book is especially useful if you are not a native English speaker or
don't have much writing experience. Combine it with Strunk and White's The
Elements of Style and you will get tremendous results in just a few hours.

The thing I liked the most about the book is Grammar Girl's gentle approach
to teaching. She never tries to be authoritative or judgmental, unlike most
of the other academically oriented authors writing about grammar. She also
offers a lot of examples, analogies and silly memory tricks: you will
always remember the difference between i.e. and e.g. after reading
[this](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/ie-versus-eg).

Grammar Girl's book helped me a lot and I can't recommend it enough.
If you are into audiobooks, be sure to pick up the audiobook version,
because her narration is as great as the content itself.

**[Spelunky (Boss Fight Books Book 11)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CYVHYSS/)**

Spelunky is a procedurally generated platformer created by Derek Yu.
It was one of the most critically acclaimed games of the last decade.
Even though I love the roguelike genre (I've spent hundreds of hours
in The Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne and Galak-Z), I've never played
Spelunky, but that didn't prevent me from reading the book about it.

Spelunky book was written by the game's author himself. I didn't have
very high expectations for it (Derek is a game designer, not a
professional writer, after all), but after only a few pages I knew
I was in for a treat. Derek presents the complete history of the game
and talks about his game-design philosophy. In today's world, where
you can get achievement for literally starting the game, games that
don't hold your hand every step of the way give you back hope. On
every page of this book I found some idea that made me think "This is how
games should be made!". This book quote best sums up Spelunky's philosophy:

>We can't have everything that we want all at once, though.
We can't know what to expect and also be surprised.
We can't be free from frustration and also be challenged.

Spelunky is built on simple ideas. Derek explains how the
levels are generated and how game characters behave. One would
think that understanding these systems would take away something
from game enjoyment, but it's the complete opposite. Many of the
game's "bugs" resulted in some fascinating new way to beat the game
([Solo Eggplant Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGrPeu5NWk0)
by Bananasaurus Rex was particularly impressive and nerve-racking).
Spelunky can be completed in
[less than two minutes]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2pG2loLdmY)),
but it takes hundreds of hours to master it.

You don't have to know anything about the game to enjoy this book.
Whether you are a gamer, a game-designer, or just a programmer, this
book absolutely belongs on your bookshelf.

**[Production-Ready Microservices: Building Standardized Systems Across an Engineering Organization](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491965975/)**

Microservices are all the rage these days, so I wanted to become more
familiar with some of the best practices in the field. This book had
some good reviews and was relatively short. Besides that, Susan J. Fowler
is probably a microservices expert, having previously worked on microservices
standardization at Uber, and currently working as an engineer on the in
infrastructure team at Stripe (she is also an Editor in Chief of
[Increment](https://increment.com/), which you should totally read).
That lead me to believe she would certainly have some unique insights
to offer. Unfortunately, this book fell short of my expectations.

Central theme of Production-Ready Microservices is building available
services, which require the following goals to be met: stability,
reliability, scalability, fault tolerance, catastrophe-preparedness,
performance, monitoring, and documentation. If you already know how
to achieve them, this book doesn't offer you anything new. If you don't,
it will not help you implementing any of them. Some of the important
topics were only mentioned in passing. For example,
service discovery has one dedicated paragraph; you can't really do
anything with that. Besides that, all of the book's
topics had been previously described more in-depth in both
[SRE Book](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html) and
[The Cloud Book](http://the-cloud-book.com/).
Even though the book is very short, it's not really packed with content; James
Hamilton talks about the most important ideas behind internet-scale services in
[less than twenty pages](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/lisa07/tech/full_papers/hamilton/hamilton_html/).
One great thing about this book are checklists at
the end of each chapter, but even they are inferior to checklists from
The Cloud Book.

Susan's heart is at the right place, but the book could have been a
lot better. She did much better job with the [Increment](https://increment.com/).
Go read it instead.

**[Distributed systems for fun and profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/single-page.html)**

Distributed systems are incredibly hard to get right; just read any of the
Kyle Kingsbury's [Jepsen](http://jepsen.io/analyses) analyses and you'll
see what I'm talking about. Even though there is a lot of literature on
the topic, most of it is in the form of academic papers, thus making it
hard for beginners to get started in the field. During one of his Jepsen
talks, Kyle mentioned this free online book as a good introduction to distributed
systems. I already had it bookmarked for more than a year, but now I finally had
some real motivation to read it.

This book only touches the surface of distributed systems. It's also very short:
less than 100 printed pages. Nevertheless, it still talks about all the important
stuff: CAP theorem and FLP impossibility, time and order, consistency models
and protocols, CRDTs, etc. Each chapter provides a high-level overview of a single topic.
You will not be able to implement any of the described algorithms, but don't worry:
each of the key papers in the field is mentioned, so you'll know where to find a
more serious treatment. Even though the book is aimed at beginners, I think some
parts of it you can understand only if you have some previous knowledge. For example,
2PC and Paxos are described briefly, but there is no way you could understand what is
really going on if this is the first time you encounter these two protocols.

You will not become an expert after reading this book, but at least you will get to
know the most important ideas behind modern distributed systems. It is also short,
so there is no excuse for not reading it. If you like it, you should also consider
reading Kyle's [notes on distributed systems](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class).
