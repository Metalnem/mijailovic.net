**[The Art of Software Security Assessment: Identifying and Preventing Software Vulnerabilities](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321444426/)**

The Art of Software Security Assessment is the definitive guide
to finding software vulnerabilities by reading source code.
Vulnerability research is not my area of expertise, so don't
just take my word for it—here's what actual software security
experts have to say about it:

>The same way you can say "TAOCP" on a programming site and
everyone knows you mean "Knuth", say "TOASSA" to a security
person and they know this book. This is the McGee, the
Cormen/Rivest, the "Theory Of Poker" for our industry:
how to find vulnerabilities by reading software.
>
> — <cite>Thomas Ptacek</cite>

>This is the Security Bug Bible. Written by some of the best
bug hunters in the business, this book describes software
vulnerability classes in a number of programming languages
and how to find them via manual source code analysis.
>
> — <cite>Dino Dai Zovi</cite>

>There are a number of secure programming books on the market,
but none that go as deep as this one. The depth and detail
exceeds all books that I know about by an order of magnitude.
>
> — <cite>Halvar Flake</cite>

This book is primarily aimed at security professionals, but most
of if will be useful to any developer who wants to better
understand the process of finding software vulnerabilities.
The meat of the book is the catalog of software vulnerabilities
where each class of bugs is explored in incredible depth.
You will learn everything there is to know about memory corruption,
C language issues, Unix privileges and files, Windows objects,
network protocols, and much, much more. The memory corruption
chapter is especially impressive and it alone is worth the price
of the book. The C programming language chapter will shatter
your dreams that it's possible to write correct C code; as it
turns out, even simple arithmetic can be a dangerous minefield
full of exploitable bugs.

Even if you don't care about security, you can learn a lot from
this book. For example, Unix chapters explain privileges, files,
and processes better than any other dedicated book. It's as close
to a perfect technical book as possible: even though it's 1200
pages long, you can't find a single filler sentence in it.
If you work in software security, this book is a must-read (but
you probably knew that already).

**[Hitler: A Biography](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393337618/)**

Hitler: A Biography is an abridged version of Ian Kershaw’s
previous two-volume biography of Hitler (even though it’s hard
to call abridged the book that’s over 1000 pages long).
Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris and Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis were
already the definitive reference books, but Kershaw decided
to condense the two volumes into one (despite his initial
reluctance) and make his magnum opus much more approachable
to the general public. The result is the best single volume
biography of the Nazi dictator.

Never before in history has such destruction been caused by
a single person. It’s possible that the World War II could
have happened even without Hitler, but such amount of evil
and inhumanity would be unimaginable without him. History of
Hitler is the history of the worst political miscalculations
in history. This book shows how the unique set of
circumstances has shaped the world history, and how Hitler's
rise to power was all but inevitable. Kershaw
does a great job debunking common myths and misconceptions
about Hitler, especially about the evolution of Hitler's
ideology and his early role in the Nazi party. It's difficult
to write a biography of a person whose personal life was
almost nonexistent, but this book still manages to reveal
surprising amount of detail, especially about the Hitler's
downfall, the last few months of his life in the bunker, and
and the gradual descend into complete paranoia and delusion.

If you are interested in knowing more about Hitler (or the
Third Reich in general), Ian Kershaw’s books are the answer;
the only question you should ask yourself is which of the
two versions you want to read.

**[Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062303023/)**

Millions of people were killed during the Holocaust. Nazi
leaders like Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and Globocnik orchestrated
the killings, but who were the actual perpetrators? Were they
all fanatical Nazis, fueled by the hatred towards the Jews,
or were they ordinary people who were just obeying the orders?
German [Order Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnungspolizei)
played important role in the Final Solution; they were initially
in charge of policing the occupied territories in the East, but
after the Operation Barbarossa they became increasingly involved
in the mass shootings of Polish Jews. Ordinary Men is the story
of one such unit—
[Reserve Police Battalion 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Police_Battalion_101).

Reserve Police Battalion 101 was a unit of around 500 people,
directly involved in killing of at least 38000 Jews, but
also responsible for deportations of even more Jews to
death camps. During the first few years of war, they were
mostly assigned to the guard duty in Poland, until one
morning in July 1942 the orders came that 1500 Jews from
the Józefów ghetto are to be killed. Only 12 of the men
decided not to participate; the rest of them complied.
This was the first of many mass shootings; it had an
enormous emotional impact on the killers initially, but
they adjusted to their new role soon after.

Christopher Browning explains how the group of ordinary
men could turn into hardened killers. Browning had a gold
mine of information in the form of testimonials of
surviving members of the battalion during the trials
for their crimes in Hamburg several decades after the war.
Most people think that making moral decisions the wartime
would be easy for them, but this book shows that it's
not so black and white. That doesn't mean that murderers
are to be excused or forgiven, just that it's possible
to understand their behavior. This book is one of the
most terrifying books I've ever read. It's also one of the best.

**[Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805092277/)**

Here we have yet another "ordinary" book, in which Amy Bach
reveals the systemic problems in the US courtrooms. The book
shows that the main problem are not the spectacular failures
that we see everyday in the news and treat them as exceptions,
but rather infinite number of mundane cases where people
are hoarded like cattle through the meat grinder that is
US criminal justice system.

No player in the system is innocent. Judges send to jail
people charged with minor crimes, whether they are guilty or
not, only because they cannot afford excessive bails. Defendants
are forced to accept guilty pleas without a lawyer being present.
Overworked and underpaid public defenders sometimes have
only a few minutes to talk to the clients and decide whether
to accept prosecutor's offer or risk going to trial, and all
of that without having the facts of the case that prosecutor
is refusing to disclose. Prosecutors don't seek justice, but
easy victories. They also sometimes zealously prosecute people,
turning a blind eye to the irrefutable evidence that
the accused is actually innocent. Each of these problems is
not the exception, but the norm.

There are no easy solutions that could fix the system.
Indigent defense needs funding, but it's never a priority.
Prosecutors have to be held accountable for their actions,
but they enjoy absolute immunity. For starters, people have
to see the criminal justice system for what it really is—this
book is a much needed eye-opener.

**[Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491941197/)**

Concurrency in Go is the latest addition to the collection
of Go books. I love reading good concurrency books, and I
also really like Go, so I was naturally excited about it.
Few weeks before the release, out of the blue, O'Reilly
announced that they are pulling the plug on their DRM-free
ebook store. That was quite a shock, and I assumed I would
probably never again read a book published by O'Reilly. But
then I discovered that all O'Reilly books are available
DRM-free on [eBooks.com](http://www.ebooks.com/)—life as
we know it could continue, after all.

Unlike other programming languages I've been working with,
official Go documentation offers more than enough material
for learning the language. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/),
[Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html),
and [The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/index) cover almost
everything you need to know. However,
simplicity of the language is a double-edged sword-Go offers
you really great low-level primitives, but that means you
often have to reinvent high-level constructs. That was something
I expected from this book: collection of patterns for writing
reliable concurrent software in Go.

First half of the book introduces the concept of concurrency,
and the basic primitives Go programming language offers: goroutines,
channels, and synchronization primitives from the sync
package. If you are familiar with Go (and you probably are if
you are reading this book), you will not learn anything new here.
Second half is much more interesting, because it delivers exactly
what I was hoping for: a collection of patterns, and how to use them
when writing software at scale. There is a lot of good stuff in here:
cancellation, timeouts, error handling and propagation, rate
limiting, supervisors, etc. Katherine didn't try to reinvent the wheel,
so you will learn to use [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/)
for cancellation, [x/time/rate](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/time/rate)
for rate limiting, and [github.com/pkg/errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors)
for wrapping errors; that is a huge plus for her in my book.

The books falls just a little bit short of being the definitive
concurrency reference. Most notable is the absence of chapter
on the Go memory model-I think every concurrency book has to
discuss the memory model. Fortunately, it's really simple
in the case of Go: you can read about it [here](https://golang.org/ref/mem).
Also, the chapter about the Go runtime is good, but the best
resources available are the two fantastic talks by Kavya Joshi:
["go test -race" Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5erqWdlhQLA) and
[Understanding Channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZlN0izeiY).

**[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)**

Unlike the other version control systems, you have to
understand Git's internals in order to use it effectively.
Articles such as [Git from the inside out](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out)
and [Git from the Bottom Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)
provide fantastic foundations, but they are still just
a starting point. I really don't care that much about Git, and
I would happily spend the rest of my life knowing only
how to commit and push code, but that's not nearly enough,
unfortunately. To really master Git, I had to bite the
bullet and finally read the Pro Git book.

This book explains everything (and I really mean
everything) you need to know about Git: from basic commands
and simple branching/merging techniques, to more advanced
concepts and ultimately Git internals. You can use this
book as a reference, but you can also read it from cover
to cover—it's fun and easy to read (with the exception
of "Git and Other Systems" chapter, which you can safely
skip unless you are currently working with some of the
legacy version control systems). Chapters "Git Tools"
and "Git Internals" are indispensable; section "Reset
Demystified" explains reset command better than any
other resource on the internet. You will also learn
tons of tricks that you will never use in the real life,
but will make you look smart in the public!

In an ideal world, we wouldn't have to read books
about version control systems, but we live in the
world where we have to use Git, and that makes the
Pro Git book a necessity (don't get me wrong—this is
actually a great book, it's just that I would rather
have spent few weeks of my life improving skills
that really matter).

**[Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0375423222/)**

Attica Correctional Facility has always been notorious
for its horrible living conditions. It was a dangerous
and overcrowded place, lacking enough food and medical
care. Prisoners' demands for better living conditions
culminated on September 9, 1971, when they took control
over the prison, taking 42 employees hostage. After four
days of intensive negotiations, governor of New York
Nelson Rockefeller decided that the state would take
back the prison by force. During the chaotic and violent
takeover, state troopers killed 43 people—33 inmates and
10 hostages. Blood in the Water is the definitive history
of this infamous event, and the victims' decades-long
fight for justice.
