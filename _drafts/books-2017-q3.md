**[The Art of Software Security Assessment: Identifying and Preventing Software Vulnerabilities](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321444426/)**

The Art of Software Security Assessment is the definitive guide
to finding software vulnerabilities by reading source code.
Vulnerability research is not my area of expertise, so don't
just take my word for it—here's what actual software security
experts have to say about it:

>The same way you can say "TAOCP" on a programming site and
everyone knows you mean "Knuth", say "TOASSA" to a security
person and they know this book. This is the McGee, the
Cormen/Rivest, the "Theory Of Poker" for our industry:
how to find vulnerabilities by reading software.
>
> — <cite>Thomas Ptacek</cite>

>This is the Security Bug Bible. Written by some of the best
bug hunters in the business, this book describes software
vulnerability classes in a number of programming languages
and how to find them via manual source code analysis.
>
> — <cite>Dino Dai Zovi</cite>

>There are a number of secure programming books on the market,
but none that go as deep as this one. The depth and detail
exceeds all books that I know about by an order of magnitude.
>
> — <cite>Halvar Flake</cite>

This book is primarily aimed at security professionals, but most
of if will be useful to any developer who wants to better
understand the process of finding software vulnerabilities.
The meat of the book is the catalog of software vulnerabilities
where each class of bugs is explored in incredible depth.
You will learn everything there is to know about memory corruption,
C language issues, Unix privileges and files, Windows objects,
network protocols, and much, much more. The memory corruption
chapter is especially impressive and it alone is worth the price
of the book. The C programming language chapter will shatter
your dreams that it's possible to write correct C code; as it
turns out, even simple arithmetic can be a dangerous minefield
full of exploitable bugs.

Even if you don't care about security, you can learn a lot from
this book. For example, Unix chapters explain privileges, files,
and processes better than any other dedicated book. It's as close
to a perfect technical book as possible: even though it's 1200
pages long, you can't find a single filler sentence in it.
If you work in software security, this book is a must-read (but
you probably knew that already).

**[Hitler: A Biography](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393337618/)**

Hitler: A Biography is an abridged version of Ian Kershaw’s
previous two-volume biography of Hitler (even though it’s hard
to call abridged the book that’s over 1000 pages long).
Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris and Hitler: 1936-1945 Nemesis were
already the definitive reference books, but Kershaw decided
to condense the two volumes into one (despite his initial
reluctance) and make his magnum opus much more approachable
to the general public. The result is the best single volume
biography of the Nazi dictator.

Never before in history has such destruction been caused by
a single person. It’s possible that the World War II could
have happened even without Hitler, but such amount of evil
and inhumanity would be unimaginable without him. History of
Hitler is the history of the worst political miscalculations
in history. This book shows how the unique set of
circumstances has shaped the world history, and how Hitler's
rise to power was all but inevitable. Kershaw
does a great job debunking common myths and misconceptions
about Hitler, especially about the evolution of Hitler's
ideology and his early role in the Nazi party. It's difficult
to write a biography of a person whose personal life was
almost nonexistent, but this book still manages to reveal
surprising amount of detail, especially about the Hitler's
downfall, the last few months of his life in the bunker, and
and the gradual descend into complete paranoia and delusion.

If you are interested in knowing more about Hitler (or the
Third Reich in general), Ian Kershaw’s books are the answer;
the only question you should ask yourself is which of the
two versions you want to read.

**[Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062303023/)**

Millions of people were killed during the Holocaust. Nazi
leaders like Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and Globocnik orchestrated
the killings, but who were the actual perpetrators? Were they
all fanatical Nazis, fueled by the hatred towards the Jews,
or were they ordinary people who were just obeying the orders?
German [Order Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnungspolizei)
played important role in the Final Solution; they were initially
in charge of policing the occupied territories in the East, but
after the Operation Barbarossa they became increasingly involved
in the mass shootings of Polish Jews. Ordinary Men is the story
of one such unit—
[Reserve Police Battalion 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Police_Battalion_101).

Reserve Police Battalion 101 was a unit of around 500 people,
directly involved in killing of at least 38000 Jews, but
also responsible for deportations of even more Jews to
death camps. During the first few years of war, they were
mostly assigned to the guard duty in Poland, until one
morning in July 1942 the orders came that 1500 Jews from
the Józefów ghetto are to be killed. Only 12 of the men
decided not to participate; the rest of them complied.
This was the first of many mass shootings; it had an
enormous emotional impact on the killers initially, but
they adjusted to their new role soon after.

Christopher Browning explains how the group of ordinary
men could turn into hardened killers. Browning had a gold
mine of information in the form of testimonials of
surviving members of the battalion during the trials
for their crimes in Hamburg several decades after the war.
Most people think that making moral decisions the wartime
would be easy for them, but this book shows that it's
not so black and white. That doesn't mean that murderers
are to be excused or forgiven, just that it's possible
to understand their behavior.

This book is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read.
It's also one the best. Highly recommended.
