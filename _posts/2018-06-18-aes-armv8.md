This is part 2 in a series of posts on using .NET Core platform intrinsics.
Part 1 discussed the implementation of SHA-256 using specialized
instructions available in the ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions. Part 2
will describe the accelerated implementation of AES encryption using
hardware instructions that are part of the same instruction set.

AES is probably the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm
today. It's a [block cipher] that can encrypt 128-bit blocks of data using
the secret key that can be 128, 196, or 256 bits long. In practice we
almost always want to encrypt variable-length messages, which is why
block ciphers are inseparable from [modes of operation] such as CBC,
CTR, or GCM. In this post I will talk about AES-128 only as a block cipher,
without implementing any particular mode of operation (don't worry, [GCM]
will be the topic of one of the future posts in this series).

## AES block cipher

The only thing you should know about AES in most situations is
that it's pseudo-random permutation that takes a 128-bit input,
a 128-bit key, and produces a 128-bit encrypted output. On the
other hand, if you want to implement it using specialized hardware
instructions, you have to know just a little bit more about how the
AES black box works internally.

AES is defined in the NIST's [FIPS 197] publication, but we are
currently interested only in high-level description of the
algorithm, which can be found on [Wikipedia] (some people also
like the [Stick Figure Guide to the Advanced Encryption Standard]).
For those who dislike clicking the links in the middle of a blog post,
here's the pseudocode of the encryption algorithm:

```csharp
var rounds = 10;
var state = input;

AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[0]);

for (int i = 1; i < rounds; ++i)
{
  SubBytes(state);
  ShiftRows(state);
  MixColumns(state);
  AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[i]);
}

SubBytes(state);
ShiftRows(state);
AddRoundKey(state, roundKeys[rounds]);
```

You can see that the core of the algorithm is actually pretty simple
(the individual operations are more complicated, but at this moment we don't
care about what they are doing internally). We have 11 different
round keys generated from the main key, and four basic operations
performed over 10 rounds. First 9 rounds are the same; the last one
is slightly different as it does not include the **MixColumns** step.

Decryption works in a similar fashion. Each transformation has its
inverse, so all the decryption algorithm has to do is to perform the
inverse operations in the reverse order. Because encryption and decryption
are very similar to each other, I'll only talk about the encryption in the
remainder of this post to avoid repeating myself (the decryption function
will be available in the GitHub repository accompanying this post).

## ARMv8 AES intrinsics

Now that you are familiar with the basic algorithm, let's see
which hardware instructions are available to us:

- **AESE** (AES single round encryption)
- **AESD** (AES single round decryption)
- **AESMC** (AES mix columns)
- **AESIMC** (AES inverse mix columns)

Looks like *almost* everything we need is here. **AESE** combines
the **AddRoundKey**, **SubBytes**, and **ShiftRows** steps, and
**AESMC** performs the **MixColumns** step, believe it or not! The
only thing that is missing is the instruction for generating the round keys
(Intel has the **AESKEYGENASSIST** instruction for that purpose),
which I will talk about later.

If you were following closely, you might have noticed that because
the instructions don't map one-to-one to AES rounds, we don't have the
last **AddRoundKey** operation covered. **AddRoundKey** is just a plain
old bitwise XOR operation, which is why we can implement it with the
simple **VEOR** instruction. All of this is best shown in this gorgeous
diagram that I personally created:

![](/assets/img/2018-06-18-aes.png)

As I mentioned previously, we are not much interested in the
instructions themselves. What we care about are the C
language intrinsics for using them, and they are defined like this:

```c
// Performs AES single round encryption
uint8x16_t vaeseq_u8(uint8x16_t data, uint8x16_t key);

// Performs AES single round decryption
uint8x16_t vaesdq_u8(uint8x16_t data, uint8x16_t key);

// Performs AES mix columns
uint8x16_t vaesmcq_u8(uint8x16_t data);

// Performs AES inverse mix columns
uint8x16_t vaesimcq_u8(uint8x16_t data);
```

The C# API looks pretty much the same:

```csharp
public static class Aes
{
  public static bool IsSupported { get; }
  public static Vector128<byte> Decrypt(Vector128<byte> value, Vector128<byte> roundKey);
  public static Vector128<byte> Encrypt(Vector128<byte> value, Vector128<byte> roundKey);
  public static Vector128<byte> MixColumns(Vector128<byte> value);
  public static Vector128<byte> InverseMixColumns(Vector128<byte> value);
}
```

## C# implementation

The first thing we need to do is to expand the secret key into 11
round keys. We don't have the intrinsics that can help us with that,
so we have to implement the key expansion from scratch. The key
expansion is not particularly interesting, so I will not
talk about it here—I will just use the pre-expanded round keys instead.
If you ever need to implement it in C#, the easiest way to do so 
would be to just copy the definition of [GenerateKeyExpansion]
function from the [RijndaelManagedTransform] class, which is a part
of the .NET Framework standard library.

The code implementing the encryption is relatively short and very
easy to follow, so I'll just show you the entire **Encrypt** function here:

```csharp
public void Encrypt(byte[] input, byte[] output)
{
  int position = 0;
  int left = input.Length;

  var key0 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[0 * BlockSize]);
  var key1 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[1 * BlockSize]);
  var key2 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[2 * BlockSize]);
  var key3 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[3 * BlockSize]);
  var key4 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[4 * BlockSize]);
  var key5 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[5 * BlockSize]);
  var key6 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[6 * BlockSize]);
  var key7 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[7 * BlockSize]);
  var key8 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[8 * BlockSize]);
  var key9 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[9 * BlockSize]);
  var key10 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref enc[10 * BlockSize]);

  while (left >= BlockSize)
  {
    var block = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position]);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key0);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key1);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key2);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key3);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key4);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key5);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key6);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key7);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key8);
    block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

    block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key9);
    block = Simd.Xor(block, key10);

    Unsafe.WriteUnaligned(ref output[position], block);

    position += BlockSize;
    left -= BlockSize;
  }
}
```

Everything looks pretty ordinary here. We are using the fact that 
we have plenty of registers available to load all the round keys
prior to the actual encryption, so we can process multiple
blocks of data much faster, in a single invocation of the function.
Each round is just one **Encrypt**/**MixColumn** combo,
except the last one, which replaces the **MixColumns** step with
the **AddRoundKey** (implemented with the simple call to **Xor**
function from the **Simd** class in the **Arm64** namespace). Now
let's see how fast we are going!

## Performance

The setup for measuring performance was the same as the one from the
previous post: Scaleway cloud instance for running the code,
BenchmarkDotNet for running the benchmarks, AES implementation from
the .NET standard library (which is again using OpenSSL behind the
scenes), and BouncyCastle's managed implementation. This time, though,
two different AES classes were available in BouncyCastle: one was slow
and safe, and the other one was fast, but not resistant to [cache-timing attacks]
(side-channel attack resistance is one of the main reasons for the existence
of AES hardware instructions, because safely implementing AES by hand is
incredibly tricky). Without further ado, here are the numbers:

|                Method |             Mean |         Error |        StdDev |
|---------------------- |-----------------:|--------------:|--------------:|
|            OpenSsl16B |        845.92 ns |     0.3094 ns |     0.2894 ns |
|         Intrinsics16B |         69.18 ns |     0.0064 ns |     0.0060 ns |
|   BouncyCastleSlow16B |      1,236.72 ns |     0.2859 ns |     0.2534 ns |
|   BouncyCastleFast16B |      1,130.88 ns |     0.3798 ns |     0.3552 ns |
|             OpenSsl1K |      3,970.90 ns |     0.2851 ns |     0.2527 ns |
|          Intrinsics1K |      2,560.72 ns |     0.2241 ns |     0.2097 ns |
|    BouncyCastleSlow1K |     67,591.19 ns |     4.9099 ns |     4.5927 ns |
|    BouncyCastleFast1K |     59,282.02 ns |     2.9021 ns |     2.7146 ns |
|             OpenSsl1M |  3,521,992.27 ns |   165.1864 ns |   154.5154 ns |
|          Intrinsics1M |  2,899,086.42 ns |   176.2553 ns |   164.8693 ns |
|    BouncyCastleSlow1M | 69,124,217.92 ns | 2,713.7717 ns | 2,538.4635 ns |
|    BouncyCastleFast1M | 60,573,568.95 ns | 2,857.6861 ns | 2,673.0811 ns |

The results are much more impressive this time. BouncyCastle is orders
of magnitude slower, as expected. But the intrinsics implementation is also
noticeably better than OpenSSL in each category of inputs: 16B, 1K, and 1M.

Single block comparison may look slightly unfair, though, as it includes big
overhead of several function calls and whatnot. Nevertheless, it's very
important when implementing some non-standard modes of operation
which use AES block cipher as a basic building block—if we can't encrypt
a single block efficiently, the performance of the whole construction
suffers greatly.

Now that the victory is officially declared, are we done here?
Not just yet—we can do even better!

## Pipelining

Modern processors are complex beasts that can juggle multiple instructions
at the same time. Thanks to [pipelining], we can have several instructions
that take multiple cycles to execute running at the same time, each of them
being in the different phase of its execution. How can we take advantage of
that in our case? Let's go back to this snippet of code from our encryption
function:

```csharp
var block = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position]);

block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key0);
block = Aes.MixColumns(block);

block = Aes.Encrypt(block, key1);
block = Aes.MixColumns(block);
```

Each **Encrypt**/**MixColumns** function call depends on the output of
the previous operation, which means the instructions cannot be executed
in parallel. We can, however, process multiple input blocks at the same
time! For example, if we want to handle four blocks in one loop iteration,
we can rearrange the code to look like this:

```csharp
var block0 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position + 0 * BlockSize]);
var block1 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position + 1 * BlockSize]);
var block2 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position + 2 * BlockSize]);
var block3 = Unsafe.ReadUnaligned<Vector128<byte>>(ref input[position + 3 * BlockSize]);

// Round 1
block0 = Aes.Encrypt(block0, key0);
block1 = Aes.Encrypt(block1, key0);
block2 = Aes.Encrypt(block2, key0);
block3 = Aes.Encrypt(block3, key0);

block0 = Aes.MixColumns(block0);
block1 = Aes.MixColumns(block1);
block2 = Aes.MixColumns(block2);
block3 = Aes.MixColumns(block3);
```

We are now issuing four independent **AESE**/**AESMC** instructions
sequentially, which should be much more efficient from the pipelining
perspective. The numbers are confirming that hypothesis:

|                Method |             Mean |         Error |        StdDev |
|---------------------- |-----------------:|--------------:|--------------:|
|          Intrinsics1K |      2,560.72 ns |     0.2241 ns |     0.2097 ns |
| IntrinsicsPipelined1K |      1,919.83 ns |     0.1546 ns |     0.1447 ns |
|          Intrinsics1M |  2,899,086.42 ns |   176.2553 ns |   164.8693 ns |
| IntrinsicsPipelined1M |  2,094,697.83 ns |   149.5739 ns |   139.9115 ns |

The performance boost is clearly visible (although not as much as
I have expected). This trick is not always applicable, though. Remember
that we always have to combine some mode of operation with the actual block
cipher? Well, not all modes can take advantage of encrypting multiple blocks
at the same time. However, some modes of operation such as CTR and GCM
are inherently parallelizable, which is where this optimization really shines.

How did I come up with the number four for the number of instructions
issued at the same time? Performance of each instruction is defined by its
latency (number of cycles needed to complete the instruction) and
throughput (number of cycles before another instruction of the same
type can be issued). You can read the [Cortex-A57 Software Optimization Guide]
to get the rough idea how some instruction will perform on the ARMv8 platform,
but ultimately you have to measure and see what works best for you in practice.

## Conclusion

You can find the complete C# implementation of both AES encryption and
decryption in my [ARMv8 AES intrinsics] GitHub repository (it currently
serves only as a demo, not as a production-ready implementation). In the
next post we will take a break from writing the code and explore the various
ways to see the instructions emitted by the JIT.
